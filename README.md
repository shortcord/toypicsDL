# ToyPics.net Downloader
It downloads the videos hosted on [Toypics](http://videos.toypics.net/) (NSFW)

Currently works on ```/{user}/public/``` list and ```/view/{vid#}/{vidTitle}/``` pages

'works' is a strong word; it downloads the video so far but there isnt much in the way of user friendliness

Depends on
- [HtmlAgilityPack](https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/)
- ~~~[CommandLine Parser Library](https://commandline.codeplex.com/)~~~

GUI Testing is available [here](https://github.com/teh-random-name/toypicsDL/releases/tag/v0.1-pre)

GUI Currently doesn't support downloading of whole userpages.
